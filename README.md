# digital-twins-for-electrochemical-and-environmental-systems

This repository contains interdisciplinary research projects at the intersection of
chemical engineering, materials science, machine learning, and environmental analytics.

The work here reflects two complementary research efforts:

1. A Gulf Impact Scholar project applying supervised machine learning to predict
   microplastic concentrations in Florida waterways and soils by modeling these systems
   as colloidal transport environments.

2. An electrochemical digital twin framework for Zn–MnO₂ battery systems, designed to
   simulate anodic and cathodic behavior, deposition/dissolution dynamics, and stability
   under varying operating conditions.

Together, these projects explore how data-driven methods can augment physical models
to improve prediction, interpretation, and decision-making in complex chemical systems.

## Project 1: Microplastic Prediction in Florida Waterways

### Motivation
Microplastic contamination poses long-term risks to ecosystems and human health,
yet sampling remains spatially sparse and resource-intensive. By treating waterways
as colloidal systems, this project integrates physicochemical intuition with
machine learning to predict microplastic concentration across environmental conditions.

### Methods
- Supervised machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Feature engineering informed by colloidal transport theory
- Environmental and geospatial datasets relevant to Florida waterways and soil systems

### Outcomes
- Predictive models for microplastic concentration
- Feature importance analysis connecting physical parameters to model behavior
- Open-source tools to support environmental research and community awareness

## Project 2: Electrochemical Digital Twin for Zn–MnO₂ Systems

### Motivation
Understanding MnO₂ deposition and dissolution in aqueous zinc batteries is critical
to improving stability and cycle life. This project develops a digital twin to explore
electrochemical behavior under controlled, simulated conditions.

### Methods
- Transport and reaction kinetics modeling
- Parameter sweeps across anodic and cathodic environments
- Comparative analysis of experimental and simulated trends

### Outcomes
- Simulated voltage profiles and polarization behavior
- Insights into dissolution mechanisms and operational stability
- A foundation for integrating data-driven optimization methods
